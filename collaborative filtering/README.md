This directory contains our implementation of the Collaborative Filtering algorithm, alongside a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of the algorithm on two datasets.

The file `collabfilter.py` contains the actual code. The two sub-directories `jester` and `movielens_small` contain the [Jester dataset](https://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/) respectively the [Movielens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), on which we test our implementation.
