This folder contains an implementation of the Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS), Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) and Resample Move particle filter algorithms.

The code for the algorithms is contained in the `particlefilters.R` file, while the accompanying RMarkdown file demonstrates the use of the algorithms on a simulated stochastic volatility hidden Markov model.

The [rendered HTML version of the document](https://rpubs.com/m__ax___/particlefilters) is available on RPubs. Alternatively, you can download the HTML file and display it in your browser.
