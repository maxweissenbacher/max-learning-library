This directory contains our implementation of the CART (Classification And Regression Trees) algorithm, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. It also contains a Jupyter Notebook in which we showcase our implementations.

The file `decisiontree.py` contains the implementation of the basic decision tree learner class, while `randomforest.py` respectively `gradientboosting.py` build upon this code to implement respectively Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. The file `metrics.py` contains code to compute metrics such as **ROC** curve, **F1** score, precision, etc.
