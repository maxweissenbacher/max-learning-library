# Machine learning learning library
 
A simple machine learning library featuring proof-of-concept implementations of fundamental statistics and machine learning algorithms in `Python` and `R`. This project serves the sole purpose of aiding my own learning of the subject.

The project is organised into different folders. Each folder contains the implementation of a different algorithm alongside a Jupyter Notebook/RMarkdown document/Shiny web app to demonstrate the use of the algorithm.

## List of implemented algorithms

- Neural networks ([Jupyter Notebook demo](https://github.com/maxweissenbacher/max-learning-library/blob/main/Neural%20Network/Neural%20network.ipynb))
- Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees
- Sequential Importance Resampling
- Kernel Ridge Regression and Kernel Smoothing
- Collaborative Filtering
- K-Means Clustering
