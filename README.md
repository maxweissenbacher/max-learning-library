# Machine learning learning library
 
 A simple machine learning library for personal educational purposes. It features simple proof-of-concept implementations of common machine learning algorithms and serves the sole purpose of aiding my own learning of the subject.

 Each algorithm is contained in itw own .py file and its use is illustrated in simple examples in an accompanying Jupyter Notebook. You can find the implementation for a certain algorithm in the corresponding folder. For instance the Python code and notebook for a neural network is contained in the folder 'neural network'.
