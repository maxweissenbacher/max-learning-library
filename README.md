# Machine learning learning library
 
A simple machine learning library featuring proof-of-concept implementations of fundamental statistics and machine learning algorithms in `Python` and `R`. This project serves the sole purpose of aiding my own learning of the subject.

## List of implemented algorithms

- Neural networks ([Jupyter Notebook demo](https://github.com/maxweissenbacher/max-learning-library/blob/main/Neural%20Network/Neural%20network.ipynb))
- Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees ([Jupyter Notebook demo](https://github.com/maxweissenbacher/max-learning-library/blob/main/Trees%2C%20Forests%20and%20Boosting/Trees%20and%20boosting.ipynb))
- Sequential Importance Resampling and Resample Move Particle Filter ([R Markdown demo](https://rpubs.com/m__ax___/particlefilters))
- Kernel Ridge Regression and Kernel Smoothing ([Interactive Shiny web app](https://maxweissenbacher.shinyapps.io/kernel_ridge_regression/))
- Collaborative Filtering ([Jupyter Notebook demo](https://github.com/maxweissenbacher/max-learning-library/blob/main/collaborative%20filtering/Collaborative%20filtering.ipynb))
- K-Means Clustering ([Jupyter Notebook demo](https://github.com/maxweissenbacher/max-learning-library/blob/main/K%20Means/K%20means.ipynb))

## Organisation of the repository
The project is organised into different folders. Each folder contains the implementation of a different algorithm alongside a `Jupyter Notebook`,`R Markdown` document or `Shiny` web app to demonstrate the use of the algorithm. The links in the list above take you directly to the demos.
