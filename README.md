# Machine learning learning library
 
A simple machine learning library for personal educational purposes. It features proof-of-concept implementations of common machine learning algorithms in PyTorch and serves the sole purpose of aiding my own learning of the subject.

The project is organised into different folders. Each folder contains the implementation of a different algorithm. The actual implementation is contained in its own .py file while its use is illustrated in simple examples in an accompanying Jupyter Notebook. For instance the Python code and notebook for a neural network is contained in the folder 'neural network'.
